summary: A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks
description: |
  pre-commit is a multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a list of hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and execution of any hook written in any language before every commit. pre-commit is specifically designed to not require root access. If one of your developers doesnâ€™t have node installed but modifies a JavaScript file, pre-commit automatically handles downloading and building node to run eslint without root.

  For more information see: https://pre-commit.com/

  This is NOT an official distribution of pre-commit, for any problem regarding the usage of this snap please refer to the snap issue tracker:

# Only PNG or SVG image is supported, dimension must be greater than 256x256px

# Version string just for humans, typically '1.2+git' or '1.3.2'
# The wrapping single quotes are often required to avoid the version string

# Base runtime
# The common runtime for the snap to run on, or `bare` for static linked applications
base: core

# Security confinement
# Use `devmode` to getting started
# Flip to `strict` once you have the right plugs and slots,
# or `classic` once you determine that strict confinement is not currently possible

# Snap Grade
# Use `devel` to getting started
# Flip to `stable` once you determine that the snap is matured, only `stable` grade
# snaps can be promoted to `candidate` and `stable` channels
grade: devel

# Run `snapcraft help sources` for supported keywords on pulling a part's source ingredients
# Run `snapcraft plugins` for supported build helper plugins
